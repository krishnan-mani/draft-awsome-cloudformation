- We follow some conventions to organise the CloudFormation template files and related artifacts. These are as follows
  - All artifacts for one kind of CloudFormation stack (such as "collaborate-on-repositories") are located within a single folder
  - The following files are located within the folder for each stack
    - template.json: CloudFormation template
    - metadata.json: Provides certain information about stacks. *This is not used by CloudFormation, but by automation we will use*
    - parameters.json: File with values for Parameters to be supplied when creating a stack
    - "contexts" folder: When different "instances" of stacks can be created from a single template, we organise them under contexts. For e.g.: each context creates a separate version control repository. 
    - "environments" folder: When different environments can be created from a single template, we can organise them under environments. For e.g.: different environments such as "dev", "qa", etc.
  - One or more manifest files (such as "manifest.yml") are located in the root of the repository. These list which stacks we wish to act upon
